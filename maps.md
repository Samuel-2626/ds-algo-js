# Maps

Maps were added as a data structure to JavaScript in the ES2015 update.

In JavaScript, a map is a collection of key-value pairs.

Maps are also known as dictionaries, hashmaps, and associative arrays in other programming languages.

Maps are used to store data in a way that uniquely identifies each element in the collection. This is done by using a key, which is a unique identifier for each element in the collection.

The key is used to retrieve the associated value.

To create a map, we use the new keyword and the Map() constructor.

To retrieve data from the map, we use the get() method.

To set data in a map, we use the set() method.

To check if a key exists in a map, we use the has() method.

To delete data from the map, we use the delete() method.

To get the size of a map, we use the size property.

To iterate/loop through a map, we can use the for...of loop.

You can also use the forEach() method to loop through a map.

You can also get the keys or values from a map using the keys() and values() methods.

To clear a map, we use the clear() method.
