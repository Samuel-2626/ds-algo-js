# Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that works in a specific way and that is First In, First Out, or FIFO. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first element removed from the queue.

When we add to the queue, we use the term enqueue. When we remove from the queue, we use the term dequeue.

We know that in JavaScript, Arrays have a push and shift method. We can use an array as a queue. We can also create our queue class that only exposes the enqueue and dequeue methods or we can create our own enqueue and dequeue methods via a class.
