# Sliding window technique

The sliding window technique is a powerful algorithm approach used to solve various array or string-related problems efficiently. It involves maintaining a "window" that slides through an array or string, allowing you to track and process a subset of elements without the need for nested loops.

This technique can be used to maximize the time complexity of your algorithm.
