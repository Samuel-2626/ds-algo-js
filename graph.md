# Graph

A graph is a versatile data structure that is similar to a tree.

It consists of nodes (also called vertices) and edges (also called links).

Each node represents an entity, and each edge represents a connection or relationship between two nodes.

Graphs are used to represent many real-world applications: Social networks, maps, etc.

## Types of graphs

Graphs can be categorized into several types based on their properties:

- __Undirected graph:__ In an undirected graph, the edges have no direction. If there is an edge between node A and node B, it implies a connection between both nodes in both directions.

- __Directed graph:__ In a directed graph, each edge has a specific direction. An edge from node A to node B indicates a one-way connection from A to B.

- __Weighted graph:__ In a weighted graph, each edge has a weight or cost associated with it. These weights represent the strength of the relationship or the distance between nodes.

- __Cyclic graph:__ A cyclic graph contains at least one cycle which means there is a close path in the graph.

- __Acyclic graph:__ An acyclic graph is a graph that does not contain any cycles.

- __Connected graph:__ A connected graph is one where there is a path between any two nodes. In other words, every node in the graph can be reached from any other node.

- __Disconnected graph:__ A disconnected graph consists of two or more separate subgraphs, and there is no path between nodes in different subgraphs.
