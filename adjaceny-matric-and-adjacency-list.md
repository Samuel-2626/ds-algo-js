# Adjacency matrix & Adjacency list

There are two main ways to implement a graph: an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list.

## Adjacency matrix

An adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional array that stores the edges between two vertices as boolean values. The rows and columns of the matrix represent the vertices of the graph.

## Adjacency list

An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or arrays that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.
