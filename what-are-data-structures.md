# Data structures

Data structures are used in every programming language.

A data structure is a way of storing and organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

They are not only used for storing data but they're also used for accessing and manipulating data.

Every language has a data structure built in. JavaScript has arrays and objects as well as maps and sets.

In addition to the built-in data structures, we have more targeted structures that work in a specific way.

Data structures are a huge topic when it comes to technical interviews. You'll be asked to implement a linked list a stack or a queue in an interview.

You'll also be asked to use a specific data structure to solve a problem. So, it's important to know how they work and when to use them.

Data structures and algorithms go hand in hand. An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem. A data structure is a way of storing and organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

## Common data structures

- Arrays
- Objects
- Maps
- Sets
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

---------

Data structures can be linear or non-linear.

A linear data structure is a structure where data is organized sequentially, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements. E.g. arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists.

A non-linear data structure is a structure where data is not organized sequentially. E.g. trees and graphs.
