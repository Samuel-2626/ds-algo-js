# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that works in a specific way and that is Last In, First Out, or LIFO. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack.

The term for removing from the top of the stack is pop.

We know that in JavaScript, Arrays have a push-and-pop method. We can use an array as a stack.

We can also create our stack class that only exposes the push and pop methods or we can create our own push and pop methods.
