# Depth First Travesal

This is a travesal algorithm where the algorithm starts at a root node, which we know is the one at the top of the tree with no parent, and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

We are going to use a stack to implement this algorithm because we want to keep track of the nodes we have visited.
