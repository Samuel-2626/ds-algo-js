# Data Structures and Algorithm - What & Why

An algorithm is a set of instructions to complete a task.

A data structure is a way to organize data in a way that makes it easy to work with. e.g Array.

Some data structures are built into certain languages e.g. JavaScript -> Arrays, Objects, Maps,
Sets. Python -> Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries.

We can also create our data structures e.g. Hash Table, Stack, Queues, Linked Lists, Binary
tree, Graphs, etc.

Data structure and algorithm go hand in hand. We use a data structure to store data, and use algorithms
to manipulate that data.

DS & Algo help you become a better programmer in general.

## Why learn DS & Algo

- To master problem-solving: Programming is all about solving problems efficiently and elegantly.
- To pass job interviews, especially at big tech.
- To write efficient code, things like time complexity, and Big O notation.
