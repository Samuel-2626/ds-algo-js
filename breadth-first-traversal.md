# Breadth First Traversal

Unlike depth-first traversal, which explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, breadth-first traversal explores all the nodes at the current depth level before moving to the next level.

To implement the breadth-first traversal algorithm, we'll use a queue data structure.
